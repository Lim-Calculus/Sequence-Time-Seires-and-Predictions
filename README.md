# Week 1
## Time Series
- Time Series typically defined as an ordered sequence of values that are usually equally spaced overtime
- Univariate Time Series : a single value at each time step

- Multivariate Time Series : time series that have multiple values at each time step

- Imputation :  In statistics, imputation is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values. When substituting for a data point, it is known as "unit imputation"; when substituting for a component of a data point, it is known as "item imputation"

## Common Pattern in Time Series
- Trend : Where time series have a specific direction that they are moving (Example : Moore's Law)
- Seasonality : pattern repeat at predictable intervals

- White noise : random value
- Autocorrelation :  it correlates with a delayed copy of itself often called a lag

## Train, Val, Test
- Splitting the time series into training, validation and test period
