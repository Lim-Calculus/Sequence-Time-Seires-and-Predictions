My Solution to DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Certificate Course 4 : Sequence, Time Seires and Predictions
# Week 1
## Time Series
- Time Series typically defined as an ordered sequence of values that are usually equally spaced overtime
![Univariate Time Series](https://github.com/Lim-Calculus/Sequence-Time-Seires-and-Predictions/blob/main/Images/Week1_Univariate_Time_Series.png)
- Univariate Time Series : a single value at each time step
- Multivariate Time Series : time series that have multiple values at each time step 
- Imputation :  In statistics, imputation is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values. When substituting for a data point, it is known as "unit imputation"; when substituting for a component of a data point, it is known as "item imputation"
